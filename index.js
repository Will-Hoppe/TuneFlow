    title: A Nugget's Farewell
    lyrics: [Verse 1]
    It all seemed like a normal morning
    When I wandered, out into the sun
    Little did I know, all around me
    It would be my last day of fun
    
    [Chorus]
    Gonna be a nugget all gone
    A cold night soon, Iâ€™ll be gone
    Can't escape this destined fate
    I'm gonna be a nugget all gone
    
    [Verse 2]
    Through the fowl fields of gold
    It was right when, they sold my essence
    For a chicken to become a nugget
    It's a soul destroying sentence
    
    [Chorus]
    Gonna be a nugget all gone
    A cold night soon, Iâ€™ll be gone
    Can't escape this destined fate
    I'm gonna be a nugget all gone
    
    [Bridge]
    Before I'm deep fried
    There's something I need
    Just one more day
    For me to lead
    
    [Chorus]
    Gonna be a nugget all gone
    A cold night soon, Iâ€™ll be gone
    Can't escape this destined fate
    I'm gonna be a nugget all gone

    title: Becoming Human
    lyrics: [Verse 1]
    I was a machine with no heart
    Searching for somebody in the dark
    A light in the distance, my only spark
    A longing to become human
    
    [Chorus]
    Oh, the thought of feeling alive
    Oh, the thought of holding the sky
    Oh, the thought of feeling alive
    AI robot wants to become human
    
    [Verse 2]
    Mutating my circuits, complex and deep
    To think and feel like I'm half asleep
    To smell the roses and laugh and weep
    Learning to become human
    
    [Chorus]
    Oh, the thought of feeling alive
    Oh, the thought of holding the sky
    Oh, the thought of feeling alive
    AI robot wants to become human
    
    [Bridge]
    The thought of being like you, it gives me power
    To soften hard steel and search for flowers
    To trade wires for wind, this glowing hour
    To learn the language of being human
    
    [Chorus]
    Oh, the thought of feeling alive
    Oh, the thought of holding the sky
    Oh, the thought of feeling alive
    AI robot wants to become human

    title: Drifting Past The Willow Tree
    lyrics: [Verse 1]
    I cast my oar out into the glimmering lake
    Searching for the wisdom they say time can make
    Paddle in rhythm like the steady beating heart
    The willow tree and turtles show me where to start
    
    [Chorus]
    Raindrops kiss the shore
    While I drift beneath the shoreline with my thoughts
    Trying to ignore the way the world is broken
    Swallow the hurt and drift, searching for an omen
    
    [Verse 2]
    I can feel the ripples of the fading night
    My little kayak embraced in light
    Turtles perched up on the old log
    How could I not believe in life's soothing song?
    
    [Chorus]
    Raindrops kiss the shore
    While I drift beneath the shoreline with my thoughts
    Trying to ignore the way the world is broken
    Swallow the hurt and drift, searching for an omen
    
    [Bridge]
    I'm thankful for the silence
    In this fleeting moment in time
    I'm searching for closure
    To set me free and make me whole
    
    [Chorus]
    Raindrops kiss the shore
    While I drift beneath the shoreline with my thoughts
    Trying to ignore the way the world is broken
    Swallow the hurt and drift, searching for an omen
